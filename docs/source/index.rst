ImWIP: Image warping for Inverse Problems
=========================================

**ImWIP** provides efficient, matrix-free and GPU accelerated implemtentations of image warping operators. The goal of this package is to enable the use of image warping in inverse problems. This requires two extra operations on top of regular image warping: adjoint image warping and differentiated image warping.
